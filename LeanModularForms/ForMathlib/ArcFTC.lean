# Arc FTC — Crossing Angles and Winding Numbers for FD Boundary

This file computes the crossing angles at the three on-curve points of the
fundamental domain boundary (`i`, `ρ`, `ρ+1`) and provides geometric lemmas
for the `ArcFTCHyp` construction.

## Mathematical content

The FD boundary crosses three special points:
- `i` at `t₀ = 2/5` (smooth crossing on the unit circle arc)
- `ρ` at `t₀ = 3/5` (corner: arc meets left vertical)
- `ρ+1` at `t₀ = 1/5` (corner: right vertical meets arc)

At each crossing, the **FTC limit** `L` satisfies `L/(2πi) = -α/(2π)`:
- At `i`: `L = -πi`, giving winding number `-1/2`
- At `ρ`, `ρ+1`: `L = -πi/3`, giving winding number `-1/6`

## Strategy

1. Compute tangent directions on each segment of the FD boundary
2. Compute the arg of each tangent at the crossing points
3. Derive the crossing angle `α = arg(L_right) - arg(-L_left)`
4. Verify consistency of FTC limits with winding numbers

## Main results

### Auxiliary
* `arg_exp_mul_I` — `arg(exp(iθ)) = θ` for `θ ∈ (-π, π]`
* `arg_ofReal_mul_I` — `arg(r·I) = π/2` for `r > 0`

### Tangent directions
* `fdBoundary_arc_deriv_eq` — derivative of arc parametrization
* `fdBoundary_arc_deriv_at_two_fifths` — arc tangent at `i`
* `fdBoundary_seg1_deriv` — right vertical tangent
* `fdBoundary_seg4_deriv` — left vertical tangent

### Crossing angles
* `fdBoundary_crossing_angle_at_rhoPlusOne` — angle at `ρ+1` is `π/3`
* `fdBoundary_crossing_angle_at_rho` — angle at `ρ` is `π/3`
* `fdBoundary_angle_at_I_partition` — angle at `i` is `π`

### Limit targets
* `arcFTC_limit_target_I` — `-(πi)/(2πi) = -1/2`
* `arcFTC_limit_target_rho` — `-(πi/3)/(2πi) = -1/6`
