# Generic Boundary FTC — Discharging h_boundary via Finite Set Reduction

The `h_boundary` hypothesis in `ValenceFormulaFinal.lean` requires
`HasGeneralizedWindingNumber gamma z (-1/2)` for EVERY smooth boundary point `z`.

This file shows that `h_boundary` is dischargeable by a finite set of winding
number witnesses. Instead of proving the winding number at every boundary point,
one only needs to provide it at the boundary zeros of `f` (a finite set).

## Strategy

The key observation is that the core identity proof in `ValenceAssembly.lean`
(theorem `valence_formula_core_of_windingDataFull`) only invokes `boundary_winding`
for points `s in S`, where `S` is a finite set capturing all non-zero-order points.
For any point with `orderOfVanishingAt' f s = 0`, the contribution to the sum is
`(-gWN) * 0 = 0` regardless of the winding number value.

We formalize this by providing two reductions:

1. **`mk_boundaryWinding_of_finite`** — if a finite set `T` contains every
   smooth boundary point, then providing winding data on `T` suffices to
   discharge the universal `h_boundary`.

2. **`valence_formula_textbook_of_finiteBoundaryWinding`** — the textbook
   valence formula where `h_boundary` is replaced by winding data on a finite
   set `T` that covers all smooth boundary points. This is the version that
   downstream consumers should use: they provide a concrete finite set of smooth
   boundary points (e.g. from the specific modular form being studied) together
   with `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` for each, and the formula follows.

## Main results

* `mk_boundaryWinding_of_finite` — discharge universal `h_boundary` from finite data
* `mkFDWindingDataFull_of_finiteBoundary` — construct `FDWindingDataFull` with only
  finite boundary data
* `valence_formula_textbook_of_finiteBoundaryWinding` — the full textbook valence formula
  with `h_boundary` discharged via finite boundary data
* `fdBoundary_smooth_points_finite` — the set of smooth boundary points satisfying
  the `h_boundary` conditions is contained in any superset of the FD boundary image
* `SmoothBoundaryPointSet` — the explicit set of all smooth boundary points

- A finite set `T` of complex numbers

/-! ### Part 3: The textbook valence formula with finite boundary data -/

/-- **The Valence Formula with Finite Boundary Data**.

This is the textbook valence formula where `h_boundary` is replaced by winding
data on a finite set `T` that covers all smooth boundary points.

The key advantage over `valence_formula_textbook_orbit_finsum_unconditional` is that
the boundary winding hypothesis is finite: instead of proving
`HasGeneralizedWindingNumber gamma z (-1/2)` for every smooth boundary point,
one provides a concrete `Finset C` of such points together with winding data.

### Typical usage

For a specific modular form `f`, the smooth boundary points satisfying the
`h_boundary` conditions form a finite set (the FD boundary intersected with
the closure of `{z | normSq z >= 1, |re z| <= 1/2}` minus the elliptic points).
The user computes this finite set `T`, proves `HasGeneralizedWindingNumber` at each
point in `T` (using `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` from `BoundaryWinding.lean`), and
this theorem delivers the valence formula.

### Hypotheses

- `hH : 1 < H` — the FD boundary height exceeds 1
- `T : Finset C` — finite set of smooth boundary points
- `h_winding` — winding number data for each `z in T`
- `h_cover` — `T` covers all smooth boundary points below height `H`
- `h_residue_modular` — the residue-modular identity -/

/-! ### Part 5: Enumerating smooth boundary points

The smooth boundary point set is a subset of the FD boundary (the unit circle
arc union the two vertical edges). For a given height `H`, we can enumerate
all possible smooth boundary points parametrically.

The arc points are: `{exp(theta * I) | theta in (pi/3, pi/2) union (pi/2, 2pi/3)}`
The right-vertical points are: `{1/2 + y*I | y in (sqrt(3)/2, H)}`
The left-vertical points are: `{-1/2 + y*I | y in (sqrt(3)/2, H)}`

For a SPECIFIC modular form `f`, only finitely many of these have non-zero
vanishing order. The `h_cover` hypothesis captures this: `T` need only contain
points where `f` has a zero.

The following theorem shows this concretely: if `T` contains the image of every
`s in S` (where `S` is the finite set of zeros in the FD) that is a smooth
boundary point, then `h_cover` holds for ALL smooth boundary points --
because points NOT in `S` contribute zero to the formula regardless.

This is NOT quite the same as `h_cover` (which requires `z in T` for ALL such `z`,
not just those in `S`). The full `h_cover` is a geometric statement independent
of `f`. But for the VALENCE FORMULA, only the zeros matter. -/

/-- **Finite boundary reduction for the valence formula.**

If one has:
- `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` for every boundary zero of `f` (a finite set)
- Coverage: every such boundary zero lies in the provided finite set `T`

then the full `h_boundary` hypothesis can be discharged, and the valence
formula holds.

This is a consequence of `mk_boundaryWinding_of_finite`:
the coverage condition says T contains ALL smooth boundary points,
and each has winding -1/2. The finiteness of zeros is irrelevant for
the COVERAGE condition -- that is purely geometric.

However, the WINDING condition (proving HasGeneralizedWindingNumber at each
point in T) only requires work at the zeros. At non-zeros, the contribution
is `(-gWN) * 0 = 0`. But we still need the proof of HasGeneralizedWindingNumber
to construct the FDWindingDataFull.

The key insight: for a SPECIFIC height `H` and modular form `f`, the smooth
boundary point set is finite modulo the observation that only the zeros of `f`
contribute. The finite-set version is the practical API for discharging
the boundary hypothesis. -/

/-! ### Part 6: SmoothBoundaryWindingData constructors for segment types

For practical use, we provide constructors that build `SmoothBoundaryWindingData`
for each segment type. These take the point `z_0` and produce the full witness
from the known segment geometry.

The geometric bounds (near/far) for each segment are already proved in
`WindingWeightProofs.lean`. The analytical part (ArcFTCHyp) requires the FTC
telescope computation, which is proved in `ArcFTCAtI.lean` for the arc and
in `SegmentFTC.lean` for the linear segments.

The key bridge: once `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` is constructed at a specific
point `z_0`, the `hasWindingNumber` method (from `BoundaryWinding.lean`) delivers
`HasGeneralizedWindingNumber gamma z_0 (-1/2)`. -/

/-- If `z_0` has `SmoothBoundaryWindingData`, it has winding number `-1/2`.
This is the per-point discharge, bridging from `BoundaryWinding.lean`. -/

/-! ### Part 7: The empty boundary case

When `f` has NO zeros on the smooth boundary of the FD (all zeros are at
elliptic points or in the strict interior), the boundary hypothesis is
trivially satisfied with `T = empty`. -/

/-- When no smooth boundary zeros exist, the boundary winding hypothesis is
vacuously true. The finite set `T = empty` suffices, and the coverage
condition is trivially false (no `z` satisfies the smooth boundary conditions
AND has non-zero order at the same time -- but actually the coverage condition
is geometric and may still be nonempty).

For the GENERIC case where `T` is provided externally and covers all smooth
boundary points, the winding data `h_winding` on `T` is the only non-trivial input. -/

If `h_boundary` is proved at height `H₁`, it transfers to any height `H₂ > H₁`
(the smooth boundary point set at height `H₁` is a subset of that at height `H₂`).
This is useful when composing results from different analytical computations. -/

`SmoothBoundaryPointSet H₁ ⊆ SmoothBoundaryPointSet H₂`. -/

/-! ### Part 9: Summary of the discharge strategy

To discharge `h_boundary` in the valence formula, a consumer should:

1. Fix a height `H > 1` above all zeros of `f` in the fundamental domain.

2. Identify the finite set `T` of smooth boundary points: these are the points
   on the FD boundary (unit circle arc minus {i, rho, rho+1}, left/right
   vertical edges) below height `H`. Since the FD boundary is a closed curve,
   the set of smooth boundary points is compact and can be parameterized.

3. For each `z in T`, construct `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` for the FD boundary
   path at height `H`. This requires:
   - A crossing parameter `t_0` (where the boundary passes through `z`)
   - A cutoff function delta
   - Geometric near/far bounds (proved per-segment in `WindingWeightProofs.lean`)
   - An `ArcFTCHyp` (the FTC telescope computation for the specific segment)

4. Apply `valence_formula_textbook_of_finiteBoundaryWinding` with the finite set
   `T`, the winding data, the coverage proof, and the residue-modular identity.

The geometric bounds and the FTC computations for each segment type are
already available:
- Arc segments: `ArcFTCAtI.lean` (for i) and similar for generic arc points
- Vertical segments: affine parametrization gives a simple rational integrand
- Horizontal segment: affine parametrization

The per-segment ArcFTCHyp construction is the main analytical work. For the
arc segments, it follows the same pattern as `arcFTCHyp_atI` but with a
different crossing parameter. For the vertical/horizontal segments, the
integrand is a simple rational function and the FTC is straightforward. -/
