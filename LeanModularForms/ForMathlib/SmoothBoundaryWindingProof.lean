# Smooth Boundary Winding Proof — Constructing `FDWindingDataFull`

This file proves that `FDWindingDataFull` can be constructed from `FDWindingData`
together with the smooth boundary winding condition, and provides pathways for
discharging that condition.

## Architecture

The `boundary_winding` field of `FDWindingDataFull` requires: at every non-elliptic,
non-interior point on the FD boundary, the generalized winding number is `-1/2`.

### Pathway 1: Direct hypothesis
`mkFDWindingDataFull` takes a `FDWindingData` and the boundary condition as a
hypothesis, producing `FDWindingDataFull`.

### Pathway 2: From SmoothBoundaryWindingData
`mkFDWindingDataFull_of_smoothData` constructs `FDWindingDataFull` from
`SmoothBoundaryWindingData` at each smooth boundary point.

### Pathway 3: Geometric classification
`smooth_boundary_classification` shows smooth boundary points fall into
two cases (vertical edge or non-elliptic arc), enabling case-by-case
construction of `SmoothBoundaryWindingData`.

## Main results

* `mkFDWindingDataFull` — assembler from `FDWindingData` + boundary hypothesis
* `boundaryWindingHyp_of_smoothData` — from `SmoothBoundaryWindingData` oracle
* `mkFDWindingDataFull_of_smoothData` — full assembler via smooth data
* `smooth_boundary_classification` — geometric dichotomy for boundary points
* `boundary_point_on_vert_edge`, `boundary_point_on_arc_range` — geometric
  descriptions of the two cases
