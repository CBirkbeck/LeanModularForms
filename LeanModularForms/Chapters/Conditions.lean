#doc (Manual) "Paper conditions (A′) and (B)" =>

The Hungerbühler–Wasem generalised residue theorem requires two
hypotheses on the geometry of the curve at crossings. *Condition
(A')* controls the flatness of the curve transverse to its tangent at
each crossing; *condition (B)* controls the relationship between
the crossing angle and the Laurent coefficients of $`f` at the
corresponding pole.

:::definition "condition-a-prime" (lean := "SatisfiesConditionA'")
*Condition (A').*
Let $`\gamma` be a piecewise-$`C^{1}` immersion based at $`x`, let
$`S_0 \subseteq \mathbb{C}` be a finite set, and let
$`\operatorname{poleOrder} : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{N}` assign a
pole order to each candidate singular point. Following
Hungerbühler–Wasem 2018, the immersion
$`\gamma` is said to *satisfy condition (A')* (relative to
$`S_0` and $`\operatorname{poleOrder}`) when:

> For every $`s \in S_0` and every interior parameter
> $`t_0 \in (0,1)` at which $`\gamma(t_0) = s`, the curve $`\gamma`
> is *flat of order $`\operatorname{poleOrder}(s)`* at
> $`t_0`. That is, on each side of $`t_0` the deviation of
> $`\gamma` from its tangent line at $`\gamma(t_0)` is
> $`o(\|\gamma(t) - \gamma(t_0)\|^{\operatorname{poleOrder}(s)})`.

Flatness of order one is automatic for a piecewise-$`C^{1}`
immersion at any interior point. Higher-order flatness is a genuine
hypothesis controlling how rapidly $`\gamma` deviates from its
tangent line at a higher-order pole.

:::definition "condition-b" (lean := "SatisfiesConditionB")
*Condition (B).*
Let $`\gamma` be a piecewise-$`C^{1}` immersion based at $`x`, let
$`f : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}`, and let $`S_0 \subseteq \mathbb{C}`
be a finite set. Following Hungerbühler–Wasem 2018, Theorem 3.3,
$`(\gamma, f)` *satisfies condition (B)* (relative to $`S_0`)
when, for every $`s \in S_0` and every interior parameter
$`t_0 \in (0,1)` with $`\gamma(t_0) = s`, both of the following
hold.

1. *Rational angle.* The *crossing angle*
   $`\alpha = \operatorname{angleAtCrossing}(\gamma, t_0)` is a
   rational multiple of $`\pi`: there exist coprime naturals
   $`p, q` with $`q \ne 0` and
   $`\alpha = p\pi/q`.

2. *Laurent compatibility.* There exist
   $`N \in \mathbb{N}`, complex coefficients
   $`a_0, \ldots, a_{N-1}`, and a function $`g` analytic at $`s`
   such that
   $$`
     f(z) = g(z) + \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}
       \frac{a_k}{(z - s)^{k+1}}
     \quad \text{for } z \text{ near } s,\, z \ne s,
   `
   and, for every $`k \ge 1` with $`a_k \ne 0`, the product $`k\alpha`
   is an integer multiple of $`2\pi`:
   $$`
     k \alpha \in 2\pi \mathbb{Z}.
   `

Geometrically, condition (B) says that the higher-order Laurent
data of $`f` at $`s` is compatible with the angle at which $`\gamma`
passes through $`s`, in the precise sense required for the
sector-cancellation identity (Hungerbühler–Wasem 2018, equation
3.4) to apply.
